; until a negative number is read in.  Then it outputs
; the sum (not including the last number).

loadAee 0 ; load value 0 in aee register

	jmpn  Done  	; jump to Done if n < 0.
	add   sum  	; add sum to the acc
	store sum 	; store the new sum
	inc
	jump  Start	; go back & read in next number
Done:	
	load  sum 	; load the final sum
	write 		; write the final sum
	load aee
